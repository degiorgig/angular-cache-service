# angular-cache-service â€” POC for caching data in AngularJS apps

The app doesn't do much, just shows how to write a service with caching capabilities.

This project is based on [AngularJS seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) to speed up the setup process.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

other dependencies are the open web API of [http://swapi.co](http://swapi.co).


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
